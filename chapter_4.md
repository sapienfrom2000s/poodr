_set wrap to 70_

An interface should know as less as possible about the external world
to make it reusable in different contexts.

Defining interfaces:
A class should have atleast public and private interfaces, so that not
everything gets exposed to the outerworld. The private parts should 
contain implementation details for public methods.
