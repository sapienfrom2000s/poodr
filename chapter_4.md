_set wrap to 70_

An interface should know as less as possible about the external world
to make it reusable in different contexts.

Defining interfaces:
A class should have atleast public and private interfaces, so that not
everything gets exposed to the outerworld. The private parts should 
contain implementation details for public methods.

UML diagrams:
Before starting to code/write tests, its important to visualize how
the internals in application will interact with each other. Having 
an idea of application on paper makes it makes it easier push and 
play around with the ideas. It also makes writing tests easier.
